"1. Number of abortions is from 2009; expenditures are estimated using the average spending per abortion in the other nonrestrictive states ($375). Notes: State policies are as of the middle of FY 2010 (April 1, 2010). States with nonrestrictive policies use their own funds to pay for most or all medically necessary abortions provided to Medicaid recipients; the policy may have been adopted either voluntarily or because of a court order. States with restrictive policies pay for abortions only in a few circumstances: when necessary to save the life of the woman or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest (which is federal policy); only to save the life of the woman (a violation of federal policy); or , 2. Numbers of abortions are rounded to the nearest 10., 3. A provider is a hospital, clinic or physician's office where abortions are performed. Physicians’ offices reporting 400 or more abortions a year are classified as clinics. , 4. Population counts are for July 1, 2017.  , 5. nr=no response or not available. , 6. Rates are the number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44; numerator includes all abortions to residents of each state, regardless of age at outcome. , 7. u = unavailable, 8. n/a = not applicable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
