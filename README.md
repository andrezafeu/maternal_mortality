# An analysis of Maternal Mortality in the USA

#### During my fellowship at Data Science for All, I led a team to analyze the Maternal Deaths of Black Women in the USA.  After our final presentation, I wanted to continue to work on this issue.
#### Therefore, I forked the project as I wanted to make the following changes:
- [x] Add the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 to the analysis
- [ ] Reorganize the repository and code (in progress)
- [ ] Improve graphs, tables and visualizations, as well as add new ones (in progress)
- [ ] Add detailed instructions and explanation so that it's not necessary to refer to a separate report to understand the results (in progress)

#### The original data used for this analysis can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality
#### If you want to run the code locally, download the files from 2005 to 2015 and save them to the `data/raw_data/cdc/` folder.  The files should follow the name convention: 2015_data.csv
